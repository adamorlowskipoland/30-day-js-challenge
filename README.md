keyboard drum kit

I started a challenge for making a small web app every day for 30 days.
This was the first task.

<br>

after 9 days I tested myself writing code without any tutorial. <br>
Troubles / differences: <br>
1. I made different protection with ‚return’ <br>
2. Needed to google the systematic for `.key[data-key=„${e.keyCode}”]`); I forgot to put ${e.keyCode} in parentheses. <br>
3. Forgot to listens ‚keydown’ event on window.
