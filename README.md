# 02\_js\_clock

Day 2
of 30 day vanilla js challenge


I have written the code with help of tutorial.
A „digital clock” I have added myself. This was not a task.


Next day have written it myself without any help.<br>
Update:<br>
after 9 days I wrote code again to test myself. You can check it in ‚testsiebie.js’ file.
