//  so changes the original variable doesn't affect the copy 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;   //it's not copy; just giving refferences to

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
//    team[3] = 'Lux'; // uncomment to see that this changes the original array
    console.log(team);
    
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players);
    
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = Array.from(players);  // making copy
    team2[3] = 'Lu';    // change value
    console.log(team2); // changed
    console.log(players); // untouched
    
    // one day
    const team3 = players.slice();
    console.log(team3);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team3);
    console.log(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team4);
    team4[3] = 'LuxX';
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team5 = [...players];
    console.log(team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3] = 'LuLuLu';
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Orlov',
        age: 25
    };
    // with Objects
    const person2 = person;
//    person2.number = 88; // uncomment to see that this gives changes also to person
    // and think we make a copy:
    console.log(person);
    console.log(person2);
//  we didn't. person2.number gave also number to person, because it is only refference
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 88 });
    console.log(person);
    console.log(person3);
//  so what is happening here. Object.assign( creates empty object {}, assign to it all value from person, and you can add additional value to it {a: x, b: y} <- this is optional )

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
//    it'd go like this... hopefully
//    const person4 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - and it will only work on 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log(orlov);
      
    // trying to make a copy of orlov
    const orlov2 = Object.assign( {}, orlov ); 
//  this will clone the object and changing assigment to it won't change assigment to original one (orlov) BUT, changing assigment in social: will affect the original
