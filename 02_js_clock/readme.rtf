# 02_js_clock

Day 2
of 30 day vanilla js challenge


I have written the code with help of tutorial.
A \'84digital clock\'94 I have added myself. This was not a task.


Next day have written it myself without any help.
Update:
after 9 days I wrote code again to test myself. You can check it in testsiebie.js file
